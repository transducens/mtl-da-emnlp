# MTL DA - EMNLP 2021
The repository contains the code needed to reproduce the experiments presented in the EMNLP 2021 paper "Rethinking data augmentation for low-resource neural machine translation: a multi-task learning approach".

## Set up environment and install software dependencies

Create a Python virtualenv and activate it:

```
virtualenv -p python3.6 ~/envs/mtl-da
source ~/envs/mtl-da/bin/activate
```

Clone and init submodules:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/transducens/mtl-da-emnlp.git
cd mtl-da-emnlp
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download data

You can download all the corpora we used in our experiments as follows:

```
wget http://www.dlsi.ua.es/~vmsanchez/emnlp2021-data.tar.gz
tar xvzf emnlp2021-data.tar.gz
```
## Compile MGIZA++

If you are going to add the "replace" or "mono" auxiliary tasks, you will need to install MGIZA++ as follows. You can skip this section if you are not going to produce synthetic data with these auxiliary tasks.

```
git clone https://github.com/moses-smt/mgiza.git
cd mgiza/mgizapp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
ln -s $PWD/../scripts/merge_alignment.py $PWD/bin/merge_alignment.py
cd ../../..
```

Once finished, export the Bash environment variable `MTLDA_MGIZAPP` with the path to the MGIZA++ installation directory. The training scripts make use of this environment variable.

```
export MTLDA_MGIZAPP=$PWD/mgiza/mgizapp/build/bin/
```

## Train baseline systems

In order to train a baseline system, run the script shown below, where the Bash variables have the following meaning:
* $L1 and $L2: source and target languages codes. Use `en` for English, `de` for German, `he` for Hebrew and `vi` for Vietnamese.
* $PAIR: language pair. We always consider English as the first language of the pair, regardless of whether it acts as the source of the target language. Possible values are `en-de`, `en-he`, and `en-vi`.
* $DIR: path to the directory that will be created during the training process and will contain files with the intermediate steps and results.
* $bpe: number of BPE merge operations. We used 10000 in all the experiments reported in the paper.
* $TRAINSET: training data to use. `iwslt` contains IWSLT training parallel data, while `iwsltbackt` also includes backtranslated monolingual English sentences extracted from TED Talks.

```
./train-baseline.sh $L1 $L2 $DIR $bpe data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/train data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/dev data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/test
```

You can find the resulting BLEU and chrF++ scores in the file `$DIR/eval/report-train`

By default, the GPU 0 as shown by the the `nvidia-smi` command will be used to train the system. If you want to use another GPU, prepend the string `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=NUM_GPU` to the training command, as in the following example:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 ./train-baseline.sh $L1 $L2 $DIR $bpe data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/train data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/dev data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/test
```


## Train systems with "reverse" or "source" auxiliary tasks

The Bash variables have the same meaning as in the previous section, and we have a new one:
* $AUXTASK: use `rev` for training with the "reverse" auxiliary task and `src` for training with the "source" auxiliary task.

```
./train-mtl1tasks.sh $L1 $L2 $DIR $bpe data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/train data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/dev data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/test $AUXTASK
```

You can find the resulting BLEU and chrF++ scores in the file `$DIR/eval/report-tune`. If that file does not exists because BLEU in the development set did not improve during finetuning, scores can be found in the file `$DIR/eval/report-tune`.

## Train systems with "token" or "swap" auxiliary tasks

The "token" and "swap" auxiliary tasks require an alpha parameter that controls the proportion of the sentence which is modified. This is the meaning of the Bash variables used in the script below:

* $AUXTASK: use `wrdp` for training with the "token" auxiliary task and `swap` for training with the "swap" auxiliary task.
* $ALPHA: proportion of the tokens in the target sentence that are modified. The best values are reported in the appendix of the paper.

```
./train-mtl1tasks.sh $L1 $L2 $DIR $bpe data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/train data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/dev data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/test $AUXTASK $ALPHA
```

## Train systems with "replace" auxiliary task

The "replace" task requires word-aligning the training data and extracting a bilingual lexicon from it. In addition to MGIZA++, we will need a working installation of Moses. Please follow the [Moses official installation instructions](http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Development.GetStarted). Once installed, export the Bash environment variable MTLDA_MOSES with the path to the Moses root directory, as in the following example:

```
export MTLDA_MOSES=/home/myuser/software/mosesdecoder
```

Once the envitonment variables `MTLDA_MOSES` and `MTLDA_MGIZAPP` have been exported, you can train a system by issuing a command similar to the ones depicted for other auxiliary tasks:

```
./train-mtl1tasks.sh $L1 $L2 $DIR $bpe data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/train data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/dev data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/test replace $ALPHA
```


## Train systems with "mono" auxiliary task

Coming soon


## Train systems with multiple auxiliary task

Just run the same script as in the previous examples, and let the variable `AUXTASK` contain the names of the tasks split by `+`. For instance, if you want to train on the combination of the "reverse" and "replace" auxiliary tasks, define `AUXTASK` as `rev+replace`, as follows:

```
./train-mtl1tasks.sh $L1 $L2 $DIR $bpe data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/train data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/dev data/$TRAINSET-$PAIR/test rev+replace $ALPHA
```

Note that, currently, the value of the alpha parameter passed as argument is used for all the tasks. Hence, if you want to combine several tasks that have an alpha parameter (e.g. swap and replace) you cannot define a different value for each task.
